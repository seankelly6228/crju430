### Lesson 7 (Wednesday 1/27/16)

* Late 19th and early 20th century explanations of crime focused on 
individuals and their personal "defects."

* Social explanations of crime became more prominent as the 20th century
progressed.

* Key assumption of social explanations: major causes of crime are located
outside -- not inside -- individual persons. 

* This is a specific elaboration of the positive school which maintained 
that the causes of crime were outside the control of specific individuals.

* Chicago was a central location for studying this problem. Two reasons for
this: (1) the city had experienced rapid growth and industrialization in 
the 1800's and early 1900's; and (2) the people at the University of Chicago 
were watching the evolution of the city closely.

* 1920's: Ernest Burgess (and Robert Park) conceived of the city as a series 
of concentric circles with different spheres of life and activity in each
zone. They referred to these different sectors as "natural urban areas" and
hypothesized that they arose as a by-product of developing American cities.

* 1930's-1940's: Clifford Shaw and Henry McKay developed the concept of
*social disorganization.*

* What is social disorganization? It is the inability of a neighborhood's 
residents to realize and implement their common values and concerns.

* What causes social disorganization? They contend there are three main
sources: (1) low social class and high poverty; (2) racial/ethnic 
heterogeneity; and (3) rapid population turnover (high in- and out-migration).

* What are the consequences of social disorganization?
  - high crime rates (officially measured) 
  - disrupted families
  - disorderly schools
  - lack of adult supervision
  - churches are weaker institutions
  - political activity is ineffective at achieving results for the neighborhood

* The lack of adult supervision leads to the formation of unsupervised
youth and teenage play groups. This phenomenon was first documented in a
qualitative analysis conducted by Frederic Thrasher (1927). 

* Shaw and McKay conducted their own intensive qualitative, in-depth interviews
with people who lived in disorganized neighborhoods to try to understand their
life stories. In your assigned reading for today, the essay discusses the
story of Sidney Blotzman.

* Unstructured and unsupervised youth play groups were hypothesized to turn
into gangs and gang-like groups. These groups end up creating an enormous
amount of crime and damage within disorganized neighborhoods. 

* A distinctive feature of Shaw and McKay's work is that they empirically
tested their own theory.
