### Quiz 4 (2/12/16)

Question: How does the relatively new concept of *collective efficacy* relate 
to the old concept of *social disorganization*?

Answer: Social disorganization relates to the inability of a community
to come together to realize its common values and achieve its common goals.
Collective efficacy includes this same idea but also expands on it to 
capture the extent to which people in a community affectively care about 
and empathize with each other.
