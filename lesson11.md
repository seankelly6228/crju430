### Lesson 11 (Monday 2/8/16)

#### Arrest is a Relatively Common Phenomenon

* Last time, I showed you some results from Ronald Christensen's research.

* A key feature of that work is the assumption it makes about the 
age distribution of an initial arrest. Here is some data to illustrate
the basis for that assumption:

* We can also look at this problem through the lens of self-report data.
Here is some analysis my colleagues and I conducted with the [National
Longitudinal Survey of Youth](http://www.bls.gov/nls/):

* It follows from this analysis that the main driver of arrest rates
in communities is not people being arrested for the first time; instead
it's because most people who are getting arrested are being re-arrested:

#### The "Chronic Offender" Problem

* Today, we are going to look at some data from the city of Philadelphia.

* The data include information on police contacts for a "birth cohort"
(a group of people who were all born during the same year).

* This Philadelphia birth cohort is comprised of all boys who were born
in the city in 1945 and who resided in the city continuously from ages
10 through 17.

* Each police contact for a criminal offense was recorded by the police
(most, but not all, of these contacts turned into arrests).
