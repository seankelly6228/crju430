## Lesson 3 (Friday 1/15/16)

### Continuing with Section 1 of Reiss (1986)

* Differential Social Organization (DSO; Sutherland, 1942; Whyte, 1943)
* Strain and anomie (Merton, 1957)
* Integration of strain and DSO (Cloward and Ohlin, 1960)
* Integration of social control and SD (Reiss, 1951; Hirschi, 1969)
* Routine activities and lifestyle theories (Hindelang et al., 1978; Cohen & Felson, 1979): individual risk can be explained "as a consequence of both
aggregate risk and perceptions of aggregate risk" (page 7).

### Social Class and Crime

* Some historical thought about this relationship.
* What is the role of co-offending and gangs? 
* Family structure and neighborhood dynamics?
* Time utilization in low social class neighborhoods? 
* Some of these ideas are highly controversial (Kornhauser 1978).

### Other Perspectives

* Differential Social Organization (DSO; Sutherland, 1942; Whyte, 1943)
* Strain and anomie (Merton, 1957)
* Integration of strain and DSO (Cloward and Ohlin, 1960)
* Integration of social control and SD (Reiss, 1951; Hirschi, 1969)
