#### Revitalization of Social Disorganization Theory

* After a period of limited interest in social disorganization theory,
important works by [Ruth Kornhauser (1978)](https://books.google.com/books?id=qVFYGwAACAAJ&dq=ruth+kornhauser+social+sources+of+delinquency&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwio0_2Y2NvKAhUE4SYKHdM7DeoQ6AEIKjAA), [Judith and Peter Blau (1982)](http://www.jstor.org/stable/2095046?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents),
and [Robert Sampson (1986)](http://www.jstor.org/stable/1147430?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) and his colleage W. Byron Groves ([Sampson and
Groves, 1989](https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/3226955/Sampson_CommunityStructureCrime.pdf?sequence=2)) reignited interest in the theory -- 
an area of active research today.

* Kornhauser (1978) re-examined the theoretical propositions of social
disorganization theory and concluded that the principal criminogenic element
in communities with high crime rates is a breakdown of controls -- not an 
inversion of the dominant cultural norms.

* Blau and Blau (1982) looked at crime rates in over 100 U.S. urban areas
and reached two major conclusions: (1) socioeconomic inequality predicts
crime rates across communities; and (2) this finding is particularly evident   
in communities where inequality between blacks and whites is larger.

* Sampson's work critiqued Shaw and McKay's original work for not fully
developing the concept of social disorganization. To address this problem,
he proposed several indicators of social disorganization using measures 
from the British Crime Survey: (1) community supervision of kids; (2) 
strength of local friendship ties; and (3) survey participants' involvement 
in neighborhood organizations. He argued that these were direct measures 
of whether a community is able to come together to realize and implement
its common values. Here is a summary of the theoretical argument from the
Sampson and Groves (1986) article:
