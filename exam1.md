### Exam 1 (2/15/16)

1. Shaw and McKay noted a number of important empirical findings. Describe the evidence which convinced them that places -- instead of the particular people who inhabited them -- have an important role in the explanation of crime?

2. In what key respect does the classical school (deterrence and rational choice) differ from the Chicago school?

3. What is the main logical problem with drawing conclusions about public safety when we rely on official record data from the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting Program?

4. How did Shaw and McKay collect their research data?

5. Early studies such as those conducted by Shaw and McKay showed strong correlations between social class and official record measures of criminal involvement. Would you say that more recent studies which have relied on self-report survey research have tended to confirm or question this finding? On what evidence is your answer based?

6. In any given year, millions of people are arrested in American communities. Based on the reading and our class discussion would you say that most of these arrests involve people who are being arrested for the very first time? Or, are they mostly recidivist arrests? What evidence would you cite in support of your answer?

7. What social behavior does the "letter study" described in Professor Sampson's video presentation attempt to capture?
