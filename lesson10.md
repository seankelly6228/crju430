### Lesson 10 (Friday 2/5/16)

#### Contemporary Ideas: Concentrated Disadvantage and Collective Efficacy

* Concentrated disadvantage: poverty, race and age composition,
and family disruption, limited access to stable primary labor market
employment, low-quality school experiences, poor physical conditions in
communities.

* Collective efficacy: ability of people who live in a community
to exert control over what happens in that community *plus* the
willingness of people who live in a community "trust and help
one another." 

#### Shaw/McKay and Kobrin Essays

* Document levels of criminal justice system involvement in high delinquency
urban areas.

* How many people are we talking about? Well, it depends.

* Juvenile commitments < juvenile court appearance < police complaints.

* "Thus, it is evident that when the most inclusive measure based on 
  official records is used, not one-fifth but almost two-thirds of the 
  boys in delinquency areas may be regarded as official delinquents."

* Linkage between juvenile and adult offending: "This is indicated by the 
findings of a recent follow-up of the careers of 83 public school boys who 
in 1929 resided in one of Chicago's delinquency areas. The individuals in 
this group were ascertained to be without recordsof appearances before 
the juvenile court prior to 1929. In 1949 an examination of their records 
of law violations during their adult careers revealed that 51% of this 
group had been arrested for offenses other than infraction of the traffic 
laws. While a sample of 69 boys with juvenile court records drawn from 
the same neighborhood during the same year exhibited an adult arrest rate 
of 75%, illustrative of the tendency of juvenile courts to deal primarily 
with the more serious and persistent offenders, the fact remains that 
over half the boys in the group of putative non-delinquents became adult 
offenders."

* What can account for these high rates of delinquency involvement?

* Different value system?

* Weak control?

* Kobrin suggests that many people co-exist in two different worlds: a world
where the norms and laws of the dominant culture are recognized but also a
world where there are immediate and short-term rewards for engaging in crime
and delinquency.

* Let's consider some additional evidence about relatively high rates
of criminal involvement. Here is a [paper](gfiles/c67.pdf).
