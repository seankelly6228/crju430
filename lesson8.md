### Lesson 8 (Friday 1/29/16)

* During the 1950's, the field's theoretical interest moved more towards
strain and learning theories (and integration of the two): Albert Cohen's
*Delinquent Boys* and Edwin Sutherland's differential association theory.

* Subsequently, the field's theoretical interest also broadened to include 
ideas like differential opportunity (Richard Cloward and Lloyd Ohlin), guilt 
neutralization and drift (Gresham Sykes and David Matza), and social control
theory (Albert Reiss, Jackson Toby, F. Ivan Nye, and Travis Hirschi).

* Methodologically, the field was also evolving in the 1950's to broaden
the measurement of crime from an exclusive reliance on official police reports
to surveys that measured self-reported crime and delinquency involvement.
Later (beginning in the 1970's) this focus would further broaden to include
data from victimization surveys.

* These surveys revealed a large amount of crime that went undetected and
unsanctioned. In addition, the survey data suggested that criminality cut
across social class boundaries. Later research would suggest that *different
types* of criminal behaviors were correlated with social class in self-report
surveys.

* This set of findings led to the social psychological idea that: 
(1) criminality is widely dispersed throughout the social structure while
at the same time the laws are disproportionately enforced against the lower
class; (2) it is possible to *over-react* to criminal behavior; (3) 
criminality tends to decline with age (after the late teens and early 20's) 
suggesting that doing nothing may -- in many circumstances -- be the best 
response to crime; (4) this over-reaction can reach the point where it 
both stigmatizes (collateral consequences) and modifies a person's 
identity so that one begins to think of him/herself first and foremost as 
a *criminal* or *offender*; and (5) changing self-concept and problems 
flowing from social stigma increase the likelihood of future criminal 
behavior (secondary deviance). This set of ideas forms the core of the
"labeling perspective" which received a good deal of attention from the 
1960's to the early 1990's.

* Beginning in the late 1970's and early 1980's researchers began to return
to the ideas of Shaw and McKay and started to look closely at how well a
revitalized version of the theory would explain patterns in modern 
neighborhood and community data sets.
