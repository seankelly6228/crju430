### Lesson 5 (Friday 1/22/16)

* Here is a table showing the number of residential burglaries as published
in the North Carolina [state crime reporting program](http://www.ncdoj.gov/crime/view-crime-statistics.aspx) for the years 2009, 2010, and 2011.

* This table reveals an adjustment for the uncertainty created by the 
Hierarchy Rule:

* Table 3 shows us the NCVS estimates of the fraction of residential 
burglaries reported to the police in 2009, 2010, and 2011 (these are 
national estimates).

* We now consider bounds on the number of residential burglaries assuming
that the city reporting rates lie within sampling error of the national
reporting rate and the Hierarchy Rule; these bounds are conservative in
the sense that the city-to-city variation is almost certainly larger than 
the 95% confidence interval.
