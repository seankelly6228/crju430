### Bulletin Description

Relationship between criminality and community characteristics, 
with particular attention to how variation in community structure, 
organization, and culture impacts crime. 

## Learning Objectives

* Understand the difference between measuring crime and criminal
justice system involvement at the individual level in comparison
to higher levels of measurement (street blocks, neighborhoods, areas
within towns and cities, etc.).

* Ability to critically assess comparisons that are often conducted
around crime and criminal justice statistics between geographic units 
over some well-defined period of time.

* Appreciate the history of criminological thought and criminal 
justice policy concerning the spatial and temporal distribution of 
crime, particularly in urban spaces (causes, consequences, and policy 
implications).

* Note: this is a writing-intensive course so it is also expected that
your writing proficiency will improve as a result of your efforts. 

## Readings 

I am not assigning a textbook for this course. Instead, I will ask
you to review an article or essay each week that will form the basis 
for that week's class sessions.

## Lecture Notes

After each class is over, I will post the talking points for that lesson 
(along with relevant charts and tables) on the [website](https://github.com/rwb/crju430) I am using for this course. This information will be accessible 
to you throughout the semester.

## Grades

Your grade in this class will be based on your grades for each of the
following items:

* Exam #1: 2/15/16 (25%)
* Exam #2: on or about 3/21/16 (25%)
* Exam #3: Monday 5/2/16 at 9:00 (25%)
* Research Paper: due on 4/25/16 (25%) 

Here are a few things to keep in mind:

* Each exam will be based on 7 short answer questions.
* Each exam is open-note.
* Each exam question can generally be answered in 2 or 3 sentences.
* You will have 50 minutes to complete each exam.
* Each exam (and the paper) will be graded on a 100-point scale.
* The average of your 4 grades will be your numeric grade for the class.

I will also administer quizzes from time to time throughout the semester
to check on your regular attendance and preparation for class. Each quiz
is a single short answer question (like the exam questions) and each quiz
is open-note (like the exam questions). The dates for the quizzes will not 
be announced in advance and missed quizzes can't be made up. At the end 
of the semester, I will take your average quiz grade and multiply it by 
0.05. I will then add those points to your final numeric grade as extra 
credit. This means your quizzes could end up adding as many as 5 points 
onto your final numeric grade in the class.

The following table shows the rule for assigning your final letter grade
in the class based on the final numeric grade you earn:

Numeric Grade | Letter Grade
-------------:|:-------------:
> 90          | A
85-89         | B+
80-84         | B
75-79         | C+
70-74         | C
65-69         | D+
60-64         | D
< 60          | F

## Research Paper

* Since this is a writing-intensive course, you will need to devote a
significant amount of effort to a writing project. In this class, the
writing project will be a research paper.

* Your research paper will be written on a communities and crime topic
approved by me. You can choose a topic from the preapproved list below
if you're struggling to identify your own topic (or if you're just 
more interested in pursuing one of the preapproved topics).

    - The current status of social disorganization theory
    - Neighborhood characteristics and crime patterns
    - "Hot-spots" policing tactics 
    - Defining "community" and "neighborhood"
    - The origins and evolution of community policing 
    - Effects of mass incarceration on communities and neighborhoods
    - Race, ethnicity, policing, and neighborhood crime

* Timeline for the development of your research paper:

    - Topic presented to me for approval by 1/29/16.
    - Submit an outline and annotated bibliography by 2/29/16.
    - Submit a rough draft of your paper by 3/31/16.
    - Final draft due on 4/25/16.

* You should turn in the requested materials by the dates listed above.
I will read what you give me and provide comments that will be designed
to help you improve your work. If you choose not to submit these materials
for review by the requested dates, I will not be able to give you comments
before the next deadline. Only the final paper is graded so the comments 
I give you on these individual elements should be viewed as a pathway 
for helping you make this paper into your best work.

* Expectations for the paper:

    - 15-20 pages (not including title page or reference list).
    - Double-spaced, 1-inch margins, 12pt. Times New Roman font.
    - At least 10 scholarly references.
    - Reference list is presented in [APA Style](http://www.apastyle.org/learn/tutorials/basics-tutorial.aspx).
    - Paper is organized into appropriate sections.
    - Research question is clearly articulated and answered.
    - An evidence-based paper; not an opinion essay.
    - If answer to the question is uncertain, explain why.
    - Factual claims are backed up with appropriate evidence.
    - Quotations are properly attributed.
    - Anticipate and address counterarguments to your claims.
    - Minimal number of spelling and grammatical errors.
    - The work you submit is your own work.
    - Paper is well argued.

* Week 15 - 4/25/16: Conclusion

## Q&A About this Class

* Do you take attendance? 
    - No.

* If I miss a quiz, can I make it up?
    - No.

* I have a really, really good reason for missing a quiz. Can I make it up?
    - No.

* If I miss an exam, can I make it up?
    - Yes, if you have a good reason (by the way, "I forgot the exam was
      today" and "I didn't know the exam was today" are not good reasons).

* Will there be a review sheet for the exams?
     - You can think of the quizzes as the "review sheet." I will allow
       some time in the last class before each exam to answer questions.

* I disagree with the way you graded my exam/quiz. Can I argue with you about
the grade you gave me?
     - Absolutely. You should make an appointment with me and we can
       talk about your concerns. Sometimes I change a student's grade
       because I'm not (even close to) perfect.

* Can I discuss my exam or quiz grade with you over email or on the telephone?
     - No, grades are only discussed in person during office hours or by
       appointment.

* Is the final exam cumulative?
     - No.

* After class is over, I want to talk to you about my grades or your
comments on my project with other students standing around. Is that okay?
    - No, there is this thing called [FERPA](http://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html) that prohibits me from saying or doing things that
could disclose your private academic information to unauthorized persons.

* I sent you an email, it's been 3 hours, and you haven't responded yet.
How long do I have to wait to hear back from you?
    - You can generally expect to hear back from me within 24 hours of your
      sending me an email. Please use your *sc.edu* email address when
      corresponding with me.

* What happens if I don't turn in my topic, outline/bibliography, and/or
rough draft by the deadlines?
    - If you don't turn them in by the deadlines then I won't be able
      to review them and give you comments. 

* What happens if I don't turn in the final draft of the paper by the
deadline?
    - If you have a good reason, then we should talk about it but we 
      should do so in a timely fashion. Whether you have a "good reason"
      and whether you have contacted me in a "timely fashion" are matters
      of judgment but let's assume that I'm going to be reasonable about
      both of these. Of course, if I don't receive a paper from you and I
      don't hear from you, I will have to assign you a grade of zero for
      the paper.

* How do I access the library's website?
    - Here is the [link](http://library.sc.edu/p/TCL).

* I have a disability and I believe I will need more time or special 
  accommodation for graded assignments. What should I do?
    - Please contact the University's [Office of Disability Services](https://www.sa.sc.edu/sds/) right away. They will meet with you to discuss any 
accommodations that might be needed and they will notify me as appropriate. 

* I don't think I'm a good writer. Is there anything I can do to improve
my writing for the paper in this class?
    - Yes. You can visit the University's [Writing Center](http://artsandsciences.sc.edu/write/university-writing-center). I encourage you to do this early
and as often as you think it necessary throughout the semester. 

* I'm thinking about cheating in this class. Can you provide me with any
useful information?
    - Happy to help; you should review the [Carolinian Creed](https://www.sa.sc.edu/creed/).  

* When you say that the exams and quizzes are open-note, does that mean I can
bring anything I want to help me with the exam?
     - Well, you have 50 minutes to answer 7 questions so that means you've
       got about 7 minutes per question. If you come to the exam thinking you
       can look up all of the answers in your notes, you will probably run
       out of time. To specifically answer the question, though, I am not 
       putting any constraints on the notes you can bring with you to the exam. 

* When you say that the exams and quizzes are open-note, does that mean I can
text my friend when the exam/quiz is underway and ask them what the right
answer is?
    - No, but -- if you try and you get away with it -- you will probably run
      out of time.

* I have a question about something we discussed in class. Should I ask in
class or speak with you outside of class? Can I email you about it?
    - Whatever you prefer is fine with me.

* I disagree with or am offended by something you (or someone else) 
said in class. Will you be upset if I speak my mind?
    - The goal in class is to seek and speak the truth. Opinions are 
      welcome but they must be expressed respectfully and they must 
      be grounded in some evidence. So, if you make a claim in class, 
      you should be prepared to defend it with evidence. If I say something
      that is incorrect (hopefully not but entirely possible) I will be
      happy to correct it and set the record straight.

* It's mid-April, I'm worried about my grade, and I have taken some/most/all 
of the quizzes. Can I get some extra credit?
     - Good news! You will be able to get up to 5 points added to your
       final number grade for the entire course depending on how many 
       quizzes you took and how well you did on them. 

* It's mid-April, I'm worried about my grade, and I haven't taken any of
the quizzes. Can I get some extra credit?
     - No.

* I'm running late for class today. Is it still okay to come?
     - I appreciate consistent and on-time attendance in this class. 
       If you have to be late, I would appreciate your entering the 
       classroom with the least possible amount of disruption. If there
       is an ongoing problem with tardiness, I will speak with you about it.

* I'm thinking about talking to the person sitting next to me because today's
material is boring to me.
     - This is disruptive and disrespectful. If you engage in disruptive 
       or disrespectful behavior, I will ask you to leave the classroom.

* I'm thinking about watching a video on my iPad because today's
material is boring to me.
     - This is disruptive and disrespectful. If you engage in disruptive 
       or disrespectful behavior, I will ask you to leave the classroom.
